**VLCKit** is a generic multimedia library for any audio or video playback needs on macOS, iOS and tvOS.

## Features

- Based on **libVLC**, the engine of the popular media player *VLC*
- Supports playback, active streaming, and media to file conversations on the Mac
- Open-source software licensed under [LGPLv2.1](http://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1/) or later, available in source code and binary form from [VideoLAN's website](http://www.videolan.org/).
- Easily integratable via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/)

## Use-case

When will you need VLCKit? Frankly, you will need it whenever you need to play media not supported by QuickTime / AVFoundation or if you require more flexibility.

Here are some other common use-cases

- Playing something else besides H264/AAC files or HLS streams
- Need subtitles beyond QuickTimeâ€™s basic support for Closed Captions
- Your media source is neither your mobile device nor a basic HTTP server, but a live stream hailing from some weird media server or even a raw DVB signal broadcasted on a local network
- and more!

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0 + / macOS 10.9+ / tvOS 10.2+
- Xcode 9.0+
- Cocoapods 1.4+

## Installation

### Cocoapods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command,

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate VLCKit into your project, specify it in your `Podfile`,

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

target '<macOS Target>' do
    platform :macos, '10.9'
    pod 'VLCKit', '3.1.2'
end

target '<iOS Target>' do
    platform :ios, '8.0'
    pod 'MobileVLCKit', '3.1.2'
end

target '<tvOS Target>' do
    platform :tvos, '9.0'
    pod 'TVVLCKit', '3.1.2'
end
```

Then, run the following command,

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Build

### Default

Run `compileAndBuildVLCKit.sh` with the `-a ${ARCH}` option to specify the target architecture.

More information can be found under `./compileAndBuildVLCKit.sh -h`

### Build with your own VLC repository

1. Put a vlc repository inside libvlc/vlc

    `mkdir libvlc && cd libvlc && ln -s ${MYVLCGIT}`

2. Apply VLC patches needed for VLCKit

    `cd vlc`

    `git am ../../Resources/MobileVLCKit/patches/*`

3. run `compileAndBuildVLCKit.sh` with the `-n` and the `-a ${ARCH}` option
