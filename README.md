## Features

- Wrapper of **libVLC**, the engine of the popular media player *VLC*.
- Supports playback, active streaming, and media to file conversations on the Mac.
- Open-source software licensed under [LGPLv2.1](http://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1/) or later, available in source code and binary form from [VideoLAN's website](http://www.videolan.org/).
- Easily integratable via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/).

## Use-case

When will you need VLCKit?

Frankly, you will need it whenever you need to play media not supported by QuickTime / AVFoundation or if you require more flexibility.

Here are some other common use-cases:

- Playing something else besides H264/AAC files or HLS streams.
- Need subtitles beyond QuickTimeâ€™s basic support for Closed Captions.
- Your media source is neither your mobile device nor a basic HTTP server, but a live stream hailing from some weird media server or even a raw DVB signal broadcasted on a local network.
- and more!

## Requirements

- iOS 8.4 + / macOS 10.9+ / tvOS 10.2+
- Xcode 9.0+
- Cocoapods 1.4+
- Python 3.7 (compile time only)

## Installation

### Cocoapods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate the latest VLCKit into your project, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

target '<macOS Target>' do
    platform :macos, '10.9'
    pod 'VLCKit', '~>3.3.0'
end

target '<iOS Target>' do
    platform :ios, '8.4'
    pod 'MobileVLCKit', '~>3.3.0'
end

target '<tvOS Target>' do
    platform :tvos, '10.2'
    pod 'TVVLCKit', '~>3.3.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
pod install
```
### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a way to add frameworks to your Cocoa application. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
brew install carthage
```

To integrate VLCKit into your project, specify it in your `Cartfile`. The URL depends on your target OS.

iOS:
```
binary "https://code.videolan.org/videolan/VLCKit/raw/master/Packaging/MobileVLCKit.json" ~> 3.3.0
```

macOS:
```
binary "https://code.videolan.org/videolan/VLCKit/raw/master/Packaging/VLCKit.json" ~> 3.3.0
```

tvOS:
```
binary "https://code.videolan.org/videolan/VLCKit/raw/master/Packaging/TVVLCKit.json" ~> 3.3.0
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
carthage update
```

Note that the following system dependencies are required and need to be linked into the project:

* AudioToolbox.framework
* AVFoundation.framework
* CFNetwork.framework
* CoreFoundation.framework
* CoreGraphics.framework
* CoreMedia.framework
* CoreText.framework
* CoreVideo.framework
* Foundation.framework
* libbz2.tbd
* libc++.tbd
* libiconv.tbd
* libxml2.tbd
* OpenGLES.framework
* QuartzCore.framework
* Security.framework
* VideoToolbox.framework

On iOS and tvOS, you also need to link:

* UIKit.framework

## Documentation
API documentation of VLCKit is available [online](https://videolan.videolan.me/VLCKit) and within both the source code as well as binary downloads. Except as indicated, all the APIs are the same on macOS, iOS and tvOS.

## Build

### Default

Make sure that Python 3.7 is installed. Get the package from https://www.python.org - do NOT use homebrew for installation as it will be ignored by VLC's build process.

Run `compileAndBuildVLCKit.sh` with the `-a ${ARCH}` option to specify the target architecture.

More information can be found under `./compileAndBuildVLCKit.sh -h`.

### Build with your own VLC repository

1. Put a VLC repository inside `libvlc/vlc`.

    `mkdir libvlc && cd libvlc && ln -s "PATH_TO_VLC"`

2. Apply VLC patches needed for VLCKit.

    `cd vlc`

    `git am ../libvlc/patches/*`

3. run `compileAndBuildVLCKit.sh` with the `-n` option.
